# Mini-Project
My client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders
## Project Background
I have created a a project meant for a cafe system where they are able to use CRUD to deal with products,courier,orders. the client wanted me to save the data so i had used a database to save all the data created when using the system.

## Client requirements

 to maintain a collection of products, couriers and orders 

• When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.

• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
  out-for-delivery, delivered.

• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.

• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.

• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

• I need to receive regular software updates

## How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

Ensuring that i had met the requirement. i had made sure that i read the requirements over and over again. Little factors such type of varible make a huge difference in the program so i had to make sure i stayed consistent in the type.

### Week 1
this was creating the very basics of the project so making a loop which will keep looking until a certain input was given. i had also added a product menu which had the CRUD functions. the functionality of this was not really effective and had many issues with it.
### Week 2
in this week i had to create courier and order menu and apply the crud functionality into it. The order menu was harder as it had to be a list of dictionary. when i had first read the specification it took me a while to understand the the dictionary needs to be nested into the list. the specificiation was not really giving enough information.
### Week 3
in this week i had to change my whole project code because the way i had done it was specific to a list and the requirements was asking for it to persisted into a list. the benifit of doing this was that the changed would be saved into a file and would be used as data.
### Week 4
this is the week i had spent most my time in and was my favoruite because it was similiar to week 3 but i would just had to change the file from txt to csv. this had given me alot of time to refactor my code and make it more understandable. in this week i had started implementing some test
### Week 5-6
with the time given week 5-6 was by far the most challenging out of all. Also it was the ones that was least explained for example i didn't know where to store my data base was we using docker or not. so i had stuck with docker. Also i had started using functionaity and modules which i have never used. After completing the specification and i encountered some issues which led to the database being deleted. Learning from my mistakes i had commented out the mysql cmds for creating database and table incase this happens again.

## Functionality
data persistence using mysql
adding my data from csv to my database
the project was based of the fundemental operation CRUD
Create
Read
Update
Delete
 The example im going to show is creating an order
## How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
If i had enough time and didnt encounter the bugs i did i was going to use testing to show my project meets the requirement but since i wasn't able to i can only manually test it myself to show it meets the requirements. i had also made sure that all variable types is what is specficied and the functionality is the same the psuedocode.

## If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
since they had given us week 5 and 6 at the same time and i had less then a week to complete it. Which was already hard enough,  i encountered an issue which crashed my whole database and leading me to create a new database.this led to most my time spent on this and not enough time on testing. my testing required me to create a fixture of database so that i was not able to figure this out in timethis which led to my testing not working.

## What did you most enjoy implementing?
i enjoyed using my creativty in creating the project but as the week went on the requirements beecome stricter so what i i enjoyed most is implementing data persistance in week 4 and then turning it into a database. Altough it was tough, the challenge and outcome was worth it.
